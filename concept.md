Project Name: Talino-Ruiziano Role: Full-Stack Developer & UX Designer

Project Goal: Build a gamified Learning Management System (LMS) designed for a research study comparing digital gamification versus traditional paper-based submissions. The app must motivate students to submit "Independent Learning Tasks" (ILTs) through rewards and productivity tools.

Brand Identity & Aesthetic (Based on Hex Codes):

Theme: Warm, academic, and encouraging.

Background: #F5D9A5 (Cream/Tan)

Primary Accent: #801B1B (Deep Maroon) for headers and navigation.

Call to Action: #FFC107 (Golden Yellow) for important buttons like "Submit" and "Log In."

Surfaces/Cards: #FFF9F0 (Off-White) for dashboard widgets and task lists.

Typography: Dark maroon (#4A0E0E) for primary text.

Core Features to Build:

Student Dashboard:

A personalized welcome area displaying a Customizable Avatar and the student's current Point Total.

A Badge Gallery that displays earned achievements (e.g., "ILT Starter," "Week 1 Finisher").

ILT Submission Portal:

A file upload system where students can submit documents (PDF/Images).

Gamification Trigger: Upon successful upload, show a "Success" animation (like confetti) and update the user's points immediately (e.g., +50 points per submission).

Productivity Hub:

Study Calendar: A visual calendar to track ILT deadlines.

To-Do List: A checklist where students can manually add and cross off study tasks.

Student Environment:

Music Corner: A floating audio player widget for study music (use a placeholder or link to a Lo-Fi stream).

Peer Chatbox: A simple community chat interface for students to ask questions.

Teacher/Researcher Admin Panel:

A secure view to see all student submissions.

A table displaying: Student Name, Submission Timestamp, File Link, and Total Points.

Data Export: A button to export this data (CSV format) for research analysis.
